# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Upload Release

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request 
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:
    - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    name: Upload Release
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build project # This would actually build your project, using zip for an example artifact
